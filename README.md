Marist College  Computer Society Fall 2013 Hackathon Project

-Designed a registration system in CUSP Assembly.  CUSP is a fictious processor and running a program requires knowing how to use a 16-bit program, or having a comupter old enough. I recommend DosBox (http://www.dosbox.com/). For the actual interface of CUSP and the files you will need I recommend this page(http://foxweb.marist.edu/users/kgbgp/cusp/index.html). 'Notes.txt' contains basic instructions on how to run CUSP from DosBox, as instructions for either program is not really supplied for.  Run the source through the programs to assemble the code and run it, just be careful with the instructions.  


-REGIST00.CSP is the CUSP file.  It is simply a mock mirror image of a simplistic Banner system, though it is completely for show in the stage in is currently and most likely indefinitetly as CUSP is not a widely used, or if ever updated language The username and password for use in the program, if you cannot tell from the file, are 'kgbgp' and '******'. Enjoy!
